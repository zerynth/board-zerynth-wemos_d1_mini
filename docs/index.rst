Wemos D1 Mini
=============

Wemos D1 Mini is a mini Wi-Fi device based on ESP8266EX chip.
This device is a very compact solution for prototyping small smart objects linked to the World Wide Web thanks to the Espressif ESP8266 Wi-Fi functionalities. The Wemos D1 Mini features 4MB of flash memory, 80MHz of system clock, around 50k of usable RAM and an on chip Wi-fi Transceiver.

Flash Layout
************

The Wemos D1 Mini device features a 4 MB (32 Mb) flash memory organized in sectors of 4k each. The flash memory address starts at 0x40200000 and can be read and written from a Zerynth program using the internal flash module.

.. warning:: If flash memory must be used in a Zerynth program, it is recommended to begin using it from secure addresses towards the end the bytecode (start address of the bytecode can be found in the log console of Zerynth Studio during the **uplink** operation), leaving a minimum safe place to minimize the chance of clashes.

.. note:: The internal flash of Wemos D1 Mini can be organized in different ways. The standard VM is a non-FOTA VM with the VM code beginning at 0x0000, followed by the esp8266 ir0m image at 0x20000 and the esp_init_data at 0x3fc000. The VM is based on the Espressif RTOS SDK 1.4.1.

Power
*****

Power to the Wemos D1 Mini is supplied via the on-board USB Micro B connector or directly via the “VIN” pin. The power source is selected automatically.

The device can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the device. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.

Connect, Register, Virtualize and Program
*****************************************

The Wemos D1 Mini exposes the serial port of the ESP8266 module via CH340 USB to UART chip which is also connected to the boot pins of the module, allowing for a seamless virtualization of the device. 

.. note:: Drivers for the CH340 Module can be downloaded `here <https://wiki.wemos.cc/downloads>`_ and are needed for **Windows and Mac platforms**.

.. note:: **For Linux Platform**: to allow the access to serial ports the user needs read/write access to the serial device file. Adding the user to the group, that owns this file, gives the required read/write access:
            
            * **Ubuntu** distribution --> dialout group
            * **Arch Linux** distribution --> uucp group

Once connected to a USB port the Wemos D1 Mini device can be seen as a Virtual Serial port and it is automatically recognized by Zerynth Studio. The next steps are:

* **Select** the Wemos D1 Mini on the **Device Management Toolbar**;
* **Register** the device by clicking the "Z" button from the Zerynth Studio;
* **Create** a Virtual Machine for the device by clicking the "Z" button for the second time;
* **Virtualize** the device by clicking the "Z" button for the third time.

.. note:: No user intervention on the device is required for registration and virtualization process

After virtualization, the Wemos D1 Mini device is ready to be programmed and the  Zerynth scripts **uploaded**. Just **Select** the virtualized device from the "Device Management Toolbar" and **click** the dedicated "upload" button of Zerynth Studio.

.. note:: No user intervention on the device is required for the upload process.

.. important:: To exploit the Wi-Fi chip functionalities of the Wemos D1 Mini, the :ref:`lib.espressif.esp8266wifi library <esp8266wifi>` must be installed (some example code is provided).

Firmware Over the Air update (FOTA)
***********************************

The Firmware Over the Air feature allows to update the device firmware at runtime. Zerynth FOTA in the Wemos D1 Mini device is available for bytecode only.

Flash Layout is shown in table below:

=============  =======  =================
Start address  Size      Content
=============  =======  =================
  0x40200000     448Kb   VM Slot
  0x40270000     256Kb   Bytecode Slot 0
  0x402B0000     320Kb   Bytecode Slot 1
=============  =======  =================

.. important:: FOTA Record (small segment of memory where the current and desired state of the firmware is store) for the Wemos D1 Mini is allocated in the RTC memory.

Power Management
****************

Power Management feature allows to optimize power consumption by putting the device in low consumption state. More information in :ref:`Power Management - ESP8266 section <pwr-esp8266>`.
